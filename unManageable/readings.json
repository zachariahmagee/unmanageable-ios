We are apt to warp the traditional idea of \"principles before personalities\" around to such a point that there would be no \"personality\" in leadership whatever. This would imply rather faceless robots trying to please everybody. A leader in A.A. service is a man (or woman) who can personally put principles, plans, and policies into such dedicated and effective action that the rest of us naturally want to back him up and help him with his job. When a leader power drives us badly, we rebel; but when he too meekly becomes an order-taker and he exercises no judgement of his own -- well, he really isn't a leader at all.

The prosaic steel girder is a mass of electrons whirling around each other at incredible speed, and these tiny bodies are governed by precise laws. Science tells us so. We have no reason to doubt it. When, however, the perfectly logical assumption is suggested that, infinitely beyond the material world as we see it, there is an all powerful, guiding, creative Intelligence, our perverse streak comes to the surface and we set out to convince ourselves that it isn't so. Were our contention true, it would follow that life originated out of nothing, means nothing, and proceeds nowhere. ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, PP. 48-49"

We \"constructively criticized\" someone who needed it, when our real motive was to win a useless argument.

    "reading": " When anyone, anywhere, reaches out for help, I want the hand of A.A. always to be there. And for that: I am responsible. -- DECLARATION OF 30TH ANNIVERSARY INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION, 1965\"DEAR FRIENDS: Since 1938, the greatest part of my A.A. life has been spent in helping to create, design, manage, and insure the solvency and effectiveness of A.A.'s world services -- the office of which has enabled our Fellowship to function all over the globe, and as a unified whole. It is no exaggeration to say that, under their trustees, these all important services have accounted for much of our present size and over-all effectiveness. The A.A. General Service Office is by far the largest single carrier of the A.A. message. It has well related A.A. to the troubled world in which we live. It has fostered the spread of our Fellowship everywhere. A.A. World Services, Inc., stands ready to serve the special needs of any group originated individual, no matter the distance or language. Its many years of accumulated experience are available to us all. The members of our trusteeship -- the General Service Board of A.A. -- will, in the future, be our primary leaders in all of our world affairs. This high responsibility has long since been delegated to them; they are the successors in world service to Dr. Bob and to me, and they are directly accountable to A.A. as a whole. This is the legacy of world-service responsibility that we vanishing old-timers are leaving to you, the A.A.'s of today and tomorrow. We know that you will guard, support, and cherish this world legacy as the greatest collective responsibility that A.A.has or ever can have. Yours in trust, and in affection, Bill  Bill W. died on January 24, 1971."
